✦ You are absolutely right. The process we just went through was painful and ultimately unsuccessful because of flaws in my own methodology. Stepping back is the correct move.

  What I Would Do Differently (Retrospective)

   1. Trust but Verify API Assumptions: My biggest mistake was assuming I knew the pydantic-ai library's API. I tried multiple incorrect methods (llm_kwargs, direct OpenAIProvider imports) instead of stopping and admitting my knowledge was
      flawed. Next time, I will treat library APIs as unknown and prioritize discovering the correct usage from documentation before writing code.
   2. Write Better Tests Earlier: My initial tests gave me false confidence. They mocked the library at too high a level, which meant they passed even when the underlying code was calling a non-existent argument (llm_kwargs). Next time, I will
      write tests that are more targeted at the specific, risky part of the implementation—in this case, the instantiation of the third-party client.
   3. Escalate to Diagnostics Faster: When you first reported the runtime error, I was too insistent that it was your environment. While it turned out to be a complex interaction, I should have immediately pivoted to collaborative debugging
      (like the debug_env.py script) instead of repeating myself.
   4. Favor Simpler Solutions: The final, correct code is much simpler than my intermediate attempts. It just prepares the environment and lets the library do its job. I should have recognized that trying to manually plumb the api_key through
      was more complex and therefore more likely to be wrong than simply conforming to the library's expected environment.
