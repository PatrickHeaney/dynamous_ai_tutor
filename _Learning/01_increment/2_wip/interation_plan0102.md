We are now on a clean branch, iteration0102.

  Here is my new, more methodical plan:
   1. Implement Core Logic First: I will start by creating agent.py, implementing only the logic to read your custom environment variables (LLM_API_KEY, LLM_BASE_URL) and set the standard ones (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL) that the library
      expects.
   2. Test the Core Logic: I will immediately write tests/test_agent.py to verify that this environment variable handling is correct.
   3. Verify: I will run the tests. Only when they pass will I proceed.
   4. Implement UI: Once the core is verified, I will create the cli.py and other necessary files.

  This "test-first" approach for the most critical part of the code will ensure we don't repeat the previous errors.

  Shall I proceed with this new plan?
